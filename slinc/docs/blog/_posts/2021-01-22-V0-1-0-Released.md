After a massive amount of work, I've finished and published the first version of Slinc. Slinc is a Scala 3 library that uses Java 17's foreign incubator to create bindings to C libraries easily. In
this release Slinc supports:

* All standard C primitives
* Binding to up to 22 parameter C functions
* Variadic C functions
* Pointers
* Function pointers
* Structs
* Platform dependent types such as time_t
* C Static Arrays
* Partial dereferencing of pointers to Structs
* and more...

If you're interested in using the library, please check out the [quick start page](../../index.md), and take a look at the [usage](../../docs/usage/index.md) section for information on how to use the library to help your program interoperate with C code!

Please note that this first release only supports Linux x86_64. Support for other platforms will follow in coming releases.

Following this release I will attempt to start a monthly feature release train for this project, and mid-month bug-fix release.
