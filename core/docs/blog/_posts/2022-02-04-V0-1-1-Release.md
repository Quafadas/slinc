I'm proud to announce the first patch release of Slinc. While it doesn't contain many new features, it does feature massive performance improvements!

## Changelog 

* A [benchmarks page](../../docs/benchmarks/index.md) was added to the site
* A simplistic blas binding was added to the project. Check [gitlab.com/mhammons/slinc] to see it.
* Bindings are now cached, increasing performance exponentially, and allowing slinc to beat jblas by a factor of 1.5x on the same data.
* `bind` and `variadicBind` have been deprecated for `accessNative` and `accessNativeVariadic`. Please read [binding C methods](/docs/usage/binding-c-methods.md) for more information.
* `Library` has been deprecated for `CLibrary` and `LibraryLocation`. Please read [binding C methods](/docs/usage/binding-c-methods.md) for more information.
* camelCase method names are now parsed to snake_case depending on capitals placement. If you want to turn off this feature, use `RawNaming`.
* `WithPrefix` has been added, allowing to specify a function name prefix and cutting down on repeated function names.

In the next release, I plan to add provisional support for Java 18, as well as C Union types.
